--:NIGHTS NOTES:


Updated notes.




--:TODO: 

Remove filler from _kb.
    the website should only focus on syntax
    bad.tuts is for how to's and what to use so remove vs code stuff etc and put it in bad.tuts
    
the idea is for bad.tuts to teach you HOW to use things while _kb teaches you the things you CAN USE



Light Mode
Dark Mode

Adjust Page Header:
if screen is X small, 
    change underscore_kb to 
    just say _kb via js

Create Drop Down:
    create dropdown for language
        --added languages to nav bar - drop down not successful yet

Add Card Counter:
    add card counter to the right hand side of the card header as a 
        new header to give better flow to cardSwapper.js functionality.

Add Swap Pause:
    create a button that allows the user to pause the swap functionality so
        they can copy and paste from the card or click links without swapping cards

Make Sure Links Open New Tab:
    just as it says

Add README.md for Github:
    just as it says

--:DONE: 
layout looks good
header bar looks good
nav bar looks good - maybe adjust colors

adjust responsiveness - currently trash
    adjusted responsiveness by removing position: absolute from the slider
    this breaks the slider functionality
    build a JS fade out or slider script that will swap cards based on an array of all the elements
        on the page with a class of box
