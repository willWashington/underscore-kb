--:NIGHTS NOTES:


Updated notes.


--:TODO: 
    Update custom Emmet article to add comment.

    Build an outline from https://www.w3schools.com/tags/.
    Restructure cards website to fit outline built in order from above site.

    Remove filler from _kb.
        the website should only focus on syntax
        bad.tuts is for how to's and what to use so remove vs code stuff etc and put it in bad.tuts
        
    the idea is for bad.tuts to teach you HOW to use things while _kb teaches you the things you CAN USE

    Add new CSS class for "What you need to know" section so that the what you need to know sentence is easily recognizable in the card.

    Adjust Page Header:
        if screen is X small, 
            change underscore_kb to 
            just say _kb via js

    Create Drop Down:
        create dropdown for language
            --added languages to nav bar - drop down not successful yet

    Add Card Counter:
        add card counter to the right hand side of the card header as a 
            new header to give better flow to cardSwapper.js functionality.

    Add Swap Pause:
        create a button that allows the user to pause the swap functionality so
            they can copy and paste from the card or click links without swapping cards

    Make Sure Links Open New Tab:
        just as it says

    Add README.md for Github:
        just as it says

--:DONE: 
    layout looks good
    header bar looks good
    nav bar looks good - maybe adjust colors
    Light Mode
    Dark Mode
    Remove any counting in the cards to accomodate possible later adjustments.

adjust responsiveness - currently trash
    adjusted responsiveness by removing position: absolute from the slider
    this breaks the slider functionality
    build a JS fade out or slider script that will swap cards based on an array of all the elements
        on the page with a class of box
