                        <p>Personally, I really like VS Code for an HTML editor. I don't have much experience with other IDE's.
                            I use VS Code for HTML, CSS, JS, and Java. It's great!
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the best things about VS Code for web development is Emmet.</p>
                        <p>Emmet is a plugin that is installed natively in VS Code. It allows for easy access to
                            code snippets for web development. Before this writing, I didn't know Emmet was a plugin;
                            I thought it was part of VS Code.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can learn more about Emmet and see what it can do <a href="https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editor/emmet/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <h1 class="card-lead">Layout</h1>
                    <p>Now that you're set up with an IDE, let's talk about layouts. This writing assumes you have a basic
                        understanding of how to create a website, so I'll skip a lot of the generics like creating your .html files and etc.                        
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp" target="_blank">This W3 Schools reference</a> is a good starting place for how to lay out your website.
                        I use the <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate VS Code extension</a> to start my pages. It's an excellent starting point for any site.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are five different ways to create a layout for a website. They can all be found on the W3 Schools link above. The site explains it well and you should
                        read it to get a better understanding. I am not experienced enough to explain them all properly. My HTML/CSS class in college just told me to read W3 pages anyway, so
                        I'll do the same.

                        <p>Now that you know a little about layouts, you can start to learn what elements make up a website. We'll start with the base elements that every
                            website must have and grow from there.
                        </p>
                        <p class="medium-text-black">
                            What is an element? Is an element a tag?
                        </p>
                        <p>An element is the entire statement. An opening tag, the internal items, and a closing tag makes up an element. This is a full element:</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <h1 class="large-text">underscore_kb</h1>   

</xmp>
                        <p>A tag is only the opening or closing section of an element. These are the tags in the above elements:</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <h1>    
    </h1>

</xmp>
                    </article>

                    <article class="box secondary-color">
                        <h1 class="card-lead">Elements 2 - Doctype</h1>
                        <p>The first element we need to discuss is the doctype element. But, this isn't actually an element.</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <!DOCTYPE html>

</xmp>
                        <p>The doctype element is actually a declaration. By using this statement, you are telling the browser that type of
                            document it is reading. 
                        </p>
                        <p>You can read more about the doctype declaration <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp" target="_blank"> here</a>.
                        If you are using XHTML, you must declare a proper doctype declaration to instruct the browser of the special intention.
                        For most websites, unless you plan on using XHTML specifically, you are free to use the html declaration, as shown above.
                        </p>                        
                        </article>

                            <h1 class="card-lead">Elements 3 - The Comment</h1>
                            <p>The comment element is used to document code. It is completely ignored when the browser processes the document.</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <!--This is a comment.-->

</xmp>
                            <p>This tag is used to add a comment to the source code. The browser processing the document will completely ignore the
                                comment. Developers use comments to explain code. They are often used to keep up with what a developer was working on when they had
                            to step away.                         
                            </p>
                            <p>Comments are useful when debugging code. Commenting out a piece of code can help you understand exactly what that piece of code is doing.
                                For instance, if you have a paragraph element that has a larger font size than you'd expect, you can comment out all of the CSS that is changing font
                                size one by one until you figure out which is causing the change.
                            </p>

                            <p>The only other thing you need to know about commenting is that you can use it to to hide scripts from browsers without support for scripts.
                                I was not aware of this prior to this writing. You can use the comment tag to "hide" script syntax from the browser in case the browser 
                                doesn't have the ability to process the script. This is shown below.
                            </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        <!--
        function displayMsg() {
            alert("Hello World!")
        }

                            <h1 class="card-lead">Elements 4 - The HTML Tag</h1>
                            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp" target="_blank">The HTML tag</a> is pretty clear cut. It tells the browser that the document is an 
                                HTML document. It represents the root of an HTML document. This means that it is the beginning of the document. It should wrap all the other elements on
                                your website except the DOCTYPE declaration.
                                The HTML tag should always follow the DOCTYPE declaration like this:
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        ...other elements...    
    </html>

</xmp>  
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Any div, p, or span tags, and all other tags, 
                                should be inside the html tag. The only exception to this rule is the DOCTYPE declaration. It will always be outside the html tag, as shown above.
                            </p>

                            <p>The html tag is also used for XHTML. I don't fully understand this, so I won't pretend to here for now. You can read more about it
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_html_xmlns.asp" target="_blank">here</a> if you're into XHTML. Yes. This is a cop out. I'm hoping to be able to
                                tell you more about XHTML one day.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The html tag can be styled with CSS. It may feel tempting to assign a background color to the html tag with CSS, but this isn't a good idea.
                                My mentors and the tutorials I've watched say this is a common rookie mistake. You often don't want your entire document to have a background color, but 
                                rather you want to build an element inside the HTML tag that represents the background. More on this later.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For now, all you really need to know is that browsers have default styles for the html tag that may cause things to not work the way you expect them to.
                                You can reset these styles in your CSS document. This topic is better suited for the CSS page, so I'm going to leave it at that.

                                The Head element is a container for elements that must go inside the head.

    Elements that go inside a head element.

                                The head element was required in HTML 4.01, but in HTML5 it can be left out. For the most part, all you need to know is that you put
                                the above elements inside the head element. You will almost definitely do this with the link and style tags. Title is required and must be in the 
                                head tag, so you'll definitely do that.
