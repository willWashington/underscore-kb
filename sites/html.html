                        <p>Personally, I really like VS Code for an HTML editor. I don't have much experience with other
                            IDE's.
                            I use VS Code for HTML, CSS, JS, and Java. It's great!

                        <p>One of the best things about VS Code for web development is Emmet.</p>
                        <p>Emmet is a plugin that is installed natively in VS Code. It allows for easy access to
                            code snippets for web development. Before this writing, I didn't know Emmet was a plugin;
                            I thought it was part of VS Code.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now that you're set up with an IDE, let's talk about layouts. This writing assumes you have a

                            understanding of how to create a website, so I'll skip a lot of the generics like creating
                            your .html files and etc.
                        </p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp" target="_blank">This W3 Schools
                                reference</a> is a good starting place for how to lay out your website.
                            I use the <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate VS Code
                                extension</a> to start my pages. It's an excellent starting point for any site.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are five different ways to create a layout for a website. They can all be found on the
                            W3 Schools link above. The site explains it well and you should
                            read it to get a better understanding. I am not experienced enough to explain them all
                            properly. My HTML/CSS class in college just told me to read W3 pages anyway, so
                            I'll do the same.

                        <h1 class="card-number">4</h1>
                        <p>Now that you know a little about layouts, you can start to learn what elements make up a
                            website. We'll start with the base elements that every
                            website must have and grow from there.

                            What is an element? Is an element a tag?
                        </p>
                        <p>An element is the entire statement. An opening tag, the internal items, and a closing tag
                            makes up an element. This is a full element:</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <h1 class="large-text">underscore_kb</h1>

</xmp>
                        <p>A tag is only the opening or closing section of an element. These are the tags in the above
                            elements:</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">

                        <h1 class="card-number">5</h1>
                        <p>The first element we need to discuss is the doctype element. But, this isn't actually an
                            element.</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <!DOCTYPE html>

</xmp>
                        <p>The doctype element is actually a declaration. By using this statement, you are telling the
                            browser that type of
                            document it is reading.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can read more about the doctype declaration <a
                                href="https://www.w3schools.com/elements/element_doctype.asp" target="_blank"> here</a>.
                            If you are using XHTML, you must declare a proper doctype declaration to instruct the
                            browser of the special intention.
                            For most websites, unless you plan on using XHTML specifically, you are free to use the html
                            declaration, as shown above.

                        <h1 class="card-number">6</h1>
                        <p>The comment element is used to document code. It is completely ignored when the browser
                            processes the document.</p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <!--This is a comment.-->

</xmp>
                        <p>This element is used to add a comment to the source code. The browser processing the document
                            will completely ignore the
                            comment. Developers use comments to explain code. They are often used to keep up with what a
                            developer was working on when they had
                            to step away.
                        </p>
                        <p>Comments are useful when debugging code. Commenting out a piece of code can help you
                            understand exactly what that piece of code is doing.
                            For instance, if you have a paragraph element that has a larger font size than you'd expect,
                            you can comment out all of the CSS that is changing font
                            size one by one until you figure out which is causing the change.
                        </p>

                        <p>The only other thing you need to know about commenting is that you can use it to to hide
                            scripts from browsers without support for scripts.
                            I was not aware of this prior to this writing. You can use the comment element to "hide" script
                            syntax from the browser in case the browser
                            doesn't have the ability to process the script. This is shown below.
                        </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <script type="text/javascript">
        <!--
        function displayMsg() {
            alert("Hello World!")
        }        
        -->
    </script>

<!-- CARD 7 -->
                    <article class="box secondary-color">
                        <h1 class="card-lead">Elements 4 - The HTML Element</h1>
                        <h1 class="card-number">7</h1>
                        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/elements/element_html.asp" target="_blank">The HTML element</a> is
                            pretty clear cut. It tells the browser that the document is an
                            HTML document. It represents the root of an HTML document. This means that it is the
                            beginning of the document. It should wrap all the other elements on
                            your website except the DOCTYPE declaration.
                            The HTML element should always follow the DOCTYPE declaration like this:
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-html">
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    ...other elements...

    </html>

</xmp>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any div, p, or span elements, and all other elements,
                            should be inside the html element. The only exception to this rule is the DOCTYPE declaration.
                            It will always be outside the html element, as shown above.
                        </p>

                        <p>The html element is also used for XHTML. I don't fully understand this, so I won't pretend to
                            here for now. You can read more about it
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/elements/att_html_xmlns.asp" target="_blank">here</a> if
                            you're into XHTML. Yes. This is a cop out. I'm hoping to be able to
                            tell you more about XHTML one day.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The html element can be styled with CSS. It may feel tempting to assign a background color to
                            the html element with CSS, but this isn't a good idea.
                            My mentors and the tutorials I've watched say this is a common rookie mistake. You often
                            don't want your entire document to have a background color, but
                            rather you want to build an element inside the HTML element that represents the background. More
                            on this later.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For now, all you really need to know is that browsers have default styles for the html element
                            that may cause things to not work the way you expect them to.
                            You can reset these styles in your CSS document. This topic is better suited for the CSS
                            page, so I'm going to leave it at that.

                            The head element was required in HTML 4.01, but in HTML5 it can be left out. For the most
                            part, all you need to know is that you put
                            the above elements inside the head element. You will almost definitely do this with the link
                            and style elements. Title is required and must be in the
                            head element, so you'll definitely do that.

                        <p>This is an appropriate time to introduce you to the DOM. 
                        </p>

                        <p>The HTML DOM is an object model for HTML. It defines HTML elements as objects. It stores properties, methods, and events for all HTML elements.                            
                        </p>

                        <p>When a page is first loaded, the browser creates a model for the page. This model is the DOM (Document Objet Model). It is a tree of elements as shown below:</p>
                        <img class="dom-img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/DOM-model.svg/800px-DOM-model.svg.png" alt="DOM Image from Wikipedia"/>
                        <p>The DOM is also an API (Programming Interface) to used with Javascript. In Javascript (or other popular JS frameworks), developers "fetch" elements housed on the 
                            DOM. This process looks like this:
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-js">
    var myElement = document.getElementById("intro");
    JS
    The above code stores the element with ID of "intro" in variable myElement.

    var allBoxes = $(".box");
    jQuery
    The above code stores all the elements with a class of "box" in an array called allBoxes.
</xmp>
                        </p>

                        <p>We haven't discussed Javascript yet, but it is important to understand that HTML, CSS, and Javascript go hand in hand. Years ago, it was safe to assume that 
                            you could build a website without using Javascript at all, but in today's world, do not let anyone tell you that you will build a modern site without Javascript                        
                        </p>
                        <p>Don't be discouraged or afraid, though! If you've made it this far, your interest in web development means that Javascript will be fun for you to play with. It
                            isn't that hard to learn, either!

                            <h1 class="card-lead">Global Attributes</h1>
                            <h1 class="card-number">11</h1>
                            <p>Now that we've discussed the DOM, we should touch on Global Attributes.</p>

                            <p>Global Attributes are an important part of web development. Arguably, CSS would not work well at all without these attributes.</p>

                            <p>That is mostly because the "class" attribute is part of global attributes. In CSS, when a developer wants to assign styling to all elements in a single group,
                                the developer will assign a class to each of those elements. The class Global Attribute can then be referenced from a CSS sheet and all elements with
                                that class will be changed by the styling.
                            </p>

                            <p>There are a lot of Global Attributes. I won't outline them all here, but you can go over the list for yourself at the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/elements/ref_standardattributes.asp">w3schools website</a>.</p>

                            <h1 class="card-lead">Event Attributes</h1>
                            <h1 class="card-number">12</h1>
                            <p>There are also Event Attributes that you can associate with HTML elements. These attributes are generally tied
                                in to Javascript functions. For instance, it is common practice to add the onclick attribute to a button that
                                will then start a function within a Javascript document.
                            </p>

                            <p>There are a lot of Event Attributes to cover, so I'll refrain from covering them here as they are already
                                covered in detail at the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp">w3schools page</a>.

                        <h1 class="card-number">13</h1>

                        <p>The next few elements are all elements that should be placed inside the head element most of the time. Some of these elements are exceptions. I'll highlight them.</p>
                        <p>The title element defines the title of the website. Whatever you put in this element will display on the tab of the page in the browser. For instance, if you look at 
                            the tab for this page, it should say "_kb - HTML". That is because I set my title element to say exactly that.
                        </p>                        
                        <p>The title element must go inside the head element.</p>

                        <p>The title element is required for all websites as of this writing. It is written as so:
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-css">
    <title>This is the title.</title>
</xmp>
                        </p>

                        <p>The title element contributes to SEO, as well. It will show up in search engine results. The title also shows up in the favorites section for users who bookmark
                            the page. 
                        </p>

                        <p>You cannot have more than one title element in an HTML document, and if you omit the title element, a site will not work.</p>

                            <h1 class="card-lead">Elements 8 - The Style Element</h1>
                            <h1 class="card-number">14</h1>
                            <p>The style element is one of the few elements that generally go inside the head element, but doesn't always have to. The style element 
                                is used to define CSS from within an HTML document. A developer can also use the style element for what is called "inline style". 
                                All this means is that you can use the style element inside the body of your document as well.
                            </p>

                            <p class="medium-text-black">What you must know: </p>
                            <p>The style element defines styling from within an HTML document.<br>
                                Multiple style elements can exist within a single HTML document.<br>
                                The style element supports Global Attributes as well as Event Attributes.
                            </p>
                            

                            <p>Those of you who went through the list of Global Attributes probably noticed the style attribute listed there. The attribute is not exactly the same
                                as the element. The style attribute can be used like the class attribute in the declaration of an element like so:
                            </p>

<xmp class="prettyprint lang-css">
    <p style="border: 1px solid red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
</xmp>

                            <p>In this instance, the paragraph element will be bordered by a solid red border that is 1px wide. This process is called inline styling.</p>

                            <p>Most experienced developers rarely rely on inline styling. This touches on a common programming concept called encapsulation. The idea is to
                                have all of your syntax regarding a certain topic in a specific location. A developer would much rather have style syntax in a style sheet so
                                that if a change is needed, the change can be made in a single place, rather than in multiple places on multiple documents.
                            </p>

                            <p>Those of you familiar with the military or government work call this separation of duties. The ideas are all the same. One person, one job. One
                                document, one job. The HTML document should contain the HTML. The CSS document should contain the CSS. And the Javascript document should contain
                                the Javascript. Writing code inline detracts from this goal, and is commonly considered bad practice.
                            </p>

                            <p>First of all, I should make sure you note that this card is named "link tag" not "link element". The reason for this is because the link tag
                                does not have a close. Or, rather, the link tag is self-closing.                             
                            </p>

                            <p>The next card will cover all of the self closing tags and how that works in depth, so let's back up to the link tag for a moment.
                            </p>

                            <p>The link tag is another tag that must be placed within the head tag. The link tag is responsible for linking to an internal or external document that
                                your document relies on. This practice commonly links an HTML document to a CSS or JS document. An internal link reference points to a 
                                document that is internal to your project. This would be if the CSS file for your website was in the same directory as your HTML document.                                
                            </p>
                            <p>For instance, let's assume your HTML document named "website.html" was located in the "Test" folder on your C: drive. The path to your HTML document would be:
                                "C:\Test\website.html". If you had a stylesheet (CSS document) named "style.css" in a folder called CSS that is inside the Test folder, the path to your stylesheet would be:
                                "C:\Test\CSS\style.css". You can link to this stylesheet with the link tag within the head element of your website.html file like this:
                            </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/style.css">
</xmp>
                            <p>This will link the style.css stylesheet to your HTML document for processing by the browser. Whatever CSS syntax in the styles.css document will be
                                processed by the browser and applied to your website.html document on load.
                            </p>

                            <p>You can reference external stylesheets the same way by just replacing the href attribute of the style tag with the URL for the stylesheet like so:
                            </p>
<xmp class="prettyprint lang-css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</xmp>
                            <p>The syntax above will pull in the Boostrap external stylesheet for your website.<br> This syntax has been simplified from the suggested syntax from the 
                                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap website</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>The concept seems difficult, but it really isn't. For you, all you need to know is:<br>
                            If you need to use a stylesheet that you created and put in a folder on your computer, use the first syntax example listed here.<br>
                            If you need to use an external stylesheet, get the URL for that stylesheet and replace the href attribute of the link tag with that URL as shown
                            in the second example.
                            </p>
